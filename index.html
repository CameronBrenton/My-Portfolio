        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Keyin College student studying Software Development<br>
          and currently living in Lewisporte Newfoundland Canada.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Thompson, Manitoba Canada for most of my life <br>
          until the journey led me to Newfoundland to be closer to family.
        </p>
        <p>
          I take pride in being kind, compassionate, respectable, and understanding of all <br> 
          therefore I am known to be VERY easy to get along with.
        </p>
        <p>I am constantly striving to learn and improve my skills, and to ascend my career to great heights</p>
        <p>
          I think software is cool and I love how computers and technology can improve all areas of life! <br>
          Computer technology has shaped our current era more than anything else. There is computer technology in some form in every area of our society. <br>
          Health, entertainment, agriculture, transportation, space-sector, military, robots, automated machines, business, sports, etc...it's everywhere. Technology can <br>
          help us with our global warming crises. Clean power from technology that doesn't harm our planet is very much real. Technology is our future and is <br>
          to going to play humanity's next crucial role in our collective evolution, sending our human species out into the depths of space in the name of exploration <br>
          Who knows what we will find out there? Knowing this leaves me happy, and makes me proud to be apart of the industry that's making it all happen  :) <br>

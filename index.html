        <p>
          I am a Keyin College student studying Software Development<br>
          and currently living in Lewisporte Newfoundland Canada.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Thompson Manitoba Canada for most of my life <br>
          until the journey led me to Newfoundland to be closer to family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I am fairly new to software development, I feel that I have found a love for it and can see myself <br>
          very easily succeeding. I want to do big things in my career! 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a fast learner, constantly striving to learn and improve my skills, and to ascend my career to great heights.</p>
        <p>
          I take pride in being kind, compassionate, respectable, and understanding of all, <br> 
          therefore I am known to be VERY easy to get along with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software and computers can improve all areas of life! <br>
          The miracle of computer technology and the internet has shaped our current era more than anything else. <br>
          There is computer technology in some form in every area of our society. Health, entertainment, education, security, <br> 
          agriculture, transportation, space-sector, military, robots, artificial intelligence, appliances, <br>
          business, communications, navigation, sports, etc...it's everywhere. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology can help us with our global warming crises. <br>
          It is our future and is going to play an integral role in humanity's evolution, placing <br> 
          the human species into the space-age as explorers of the universe. <br> 
          Who knows what we will find out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to be a part of the technology industry that is critical to building that future.  :)
